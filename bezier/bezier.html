            A third degree Bezier curve is defined by four points: P0,P1,P2 and P3.
        </P>
        <P>
            The curve is constructed as follows:<BR>
            On the segments P0P1, P1P2 and P2P3 the points Q0,Q1 and Q2 are drawn such that  P0Q0/P0P1=P1Q1/P1P2=P2Q2/P2P3=t (t in [0,1]).<BR>
            On the segments Q0Q1 and Q1Q2 the points R0 and R1 are drawn such that
            Q0R0/Q0Q1=Q1R1/Q1Q2=t for the same value of t.<BR>
            On the segment R0R1 the point B is drawn such that R0B/R0R1=t for the same value of t.</BR>
            The Bezier curve defined by the points P0, P1, P2, P3 is the locus of B as Q0 takes all possible positions on the segment P0P1. (Please note that for all points the value of t is the same.) 
            <BR>
        </p>
        <P>
            In the canvas app above you can drag the points P0, P1, P2 and P3 to see what the Bezier curve (green curve) defined by those points  looks like.
        </P>
        <P>
            From the construction it is clear that the bezier curve will be tangent to the segments P0P1 in P0 and P2P3 in P3.
