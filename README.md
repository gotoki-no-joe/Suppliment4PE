# Suppliment for Project Euler

## Content

### [BÃ©zier Curves Animation](./bezier/bezier.html) for Problem 363

The first edition of the problem had Java applet "CabriJava.jar" embedded.
Later it was replaced by the link to the external page http://home.kpn.nl/hklein/bezier/bezier.html .
Finally Java applet support terminated and simply the sentence was deleted.
So I made a clone of the Java applet page with TypeScript/Canvas.
